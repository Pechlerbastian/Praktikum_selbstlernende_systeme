## Name
Fritzi - A virtual interactive 3D companion

## Description
Fritzi is an interactive 3D virtual companion with the ability to communicate, detect and classify objects specified by the user. Therefore, a combination of different techniques in the areas of machine learning, computer vision, voice interaction and web modelling are used. Images can be provided by an upload function or via webcam feed. After starting the webcam, the objects in the feed are localized and marked with bounding boxes. The resulting object for classification can be selected by fingerpointing on a bounding box using your index fingertip. Besides classifying the object Fritzi allows the user to add and show synonym labels, new labels and explain the result of the prediction. Moreover, it is possible to use voice interaction and retrain the model when new labels are added. Therefore, new images for the training process can be downloaded from the internet.
